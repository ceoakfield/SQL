/**C. Oakfield 6/22/24
This project worked with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for customers, invoices, artists, albums, tracks and more: 11 tables in total. 
Upon importing the dataset, I reviewed the: contents, database relationship diagram, and then queried the data  **/

/** Basic Queries (1-22) to get to know the data:Nice to meet you data, tell me about yourself.
Viewed 10 rows in each table and counted rows in each table.
