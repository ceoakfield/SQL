-- Q1: Select first 5 rows of data for general planning of queries
SELECT * FROM superstore LIMIT 5;

-- Q2: Order items by price descending
SELECT item_name, category, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price DESC;

-- Q3: Quick query of superstore status using aggregates
SELECT max (price) MaxPrice, min (price) MinPrice, avg (price) AvgPrice, avg (average_rating) AvgRating, count (item_name) TotalItems, sum(stock_quantity) InventoryTotalPieces, sum(price) CurrentInventoryValue
FROM superstore;

-- Q4: Take a look at the avg/min/max of the ratings in the kitchen supply category to consider value of category
SELECT avg(average_rating) AvgRating, min(average_rating) MinRating, max (average_rating) MaxRating, count(average_rating) TotalRatings
FROM superstore
WHERE category = "Kitchen Supplies";
