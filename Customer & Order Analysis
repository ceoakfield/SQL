In this SQL, I'm querying a database (SQLLiteStudio) with multiple tables in it (thousands of records in each table) to quantify statistics about customer and order data.
As always starting with basic queries to get to know the data and building from there.
**/

/** Basic Queries (1-3) to get to know the data
Nice to meet you data, tell me about yourself.
**/
-- Q1: How many rows of data are in the customers table? 
SELECT count(*) from customers;

-- Q2: Noting some data is questionable, removing invalid/unhelpful data from query
SELECT * 
FROM customers
WHERE order_id <> "Order ID" AND length(order_id) =6
;
-- Q3: See 5 rows of data from a month of sales for planning purposes
SELECT * from AprSales
LIMIT 5
;

-- Q4 (Question 1):  How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT count(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
;

-- Q5 (Question 2): How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT count(*) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND Product = "iPhone"
;

-- Q6 (Question 3): Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT DISTINCT cust.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as feb
LEFT JOIN customers as cust
        ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE length(cust.order_id) = 6
ORDER BY cust.acctnum
;

-- Q7 (Question 4): Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT Product, Price
FROM JanSales
WHERE Price = (SELECT Min(Price)
                 FROM JanSales)
;

--Q8 (Question 5): What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT Jan.Product, ROUND(SUM(Jan.price* Jan.Quantity), 2) TotalRevenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
WHERE Jan.Product <> 'Product' AND Jan.Product <> ""
GROUP BY Jan. Product
ORDER BY TotalRevenue ASC
;


--Q9 (Question 6): Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, Quantity, Quantity * Price TotalRevenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE "548 Lincoln%"
;


--Q10 (Question 7): How many customers ordered more than 2 products (can be the same product) AT A TIME in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(DISTINCT Cust.acctnum) NumProducts, Round(Avg(Quantity *Price),2) Avg
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers Cust
        ON Feb.orderID = Cust.order_ID
WHERE length(Feb.orderID) = 6 
AND Feb.Quantity>2
;

--Q11 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, Sum (Quantity)
FROM FebSales
WHERE location LIKE "%Los Angeles%"
Group By Product
Order by Product ASC
;

-- Q12 Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).

SELECT DISTINCT location, count(location)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
Where location Like "%NY%"
Group by location
HAVING count(location)>2
ORDER BY location
;

-- Q13 How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product Like "%Headphones%"
GROUP BY product
;

-- Q14 What was the average amount spent per account in February? we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol

SELECT ROUND(SUM(Feb.Quantity * Feb.price)/count(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), 2) AvgAmountSpentPerAccount
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
        ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE Length(Feb.orderID) = 6
;

-- Q15 What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT SUM(Feb.Quantity)/count(Distinct cust.acctnum) AvgQuantitytPerAccount
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
        ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE Length(Feb.orderID) = 6
;

-- Q16 Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT product, SUM(Quantity*Price) TotalRevenue
from BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
LIMIT 1
;

--The above works unless another item has the same total, do a quick check using this query

SELECT product, SUM(Quantity*Price) TotalRevenue
from BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
;
