This project contains a portion of downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. 
I created a table to insert the Spotify data into from a .csv file
Finally, I performed some analytics on the data.  **/

-- Create Table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

-- Q1: Query table to get to know the data


SELECT * FROM Spotifydata;

-- Q2 What is the average danceability by artist Group by artist, View Danceability as a percentage rounding to two digits and order descending

SELECT artist_name, ROUND((avg(danceability) * 100), 2) DanceabilityPercentage
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY Danceability DESC
;

-- Q3 What is the shortest song and who released it? 
SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE duration_ms = (select min(duration_ms)
                    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
                    )
ORDER BY duration_ms ASC
;

-- Q4 What is the longest song and who released it? 

SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE duration_ms = (select max(duration_ms)
                    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
                    )
ORDER BY duration_ms ASC
;

-- Q5 What is the average length of all of the songs, rounded to two digits after the decimal

SELECT ROUND(((AVG(duration_ms)/1000)/60), 2) AvgDuration
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
;
--Note: rounds to a final zero and that digit is left off.

-- Q6 What are the top 5 most popular high energy songs?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE energy >.7 
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 5;
