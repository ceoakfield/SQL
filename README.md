## Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written. Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions. 

_I'm thrilled to be diving back into the tech world after dedicating time to raising and educating my daughter. Before my parenting adventure, I was a proficient programmer/analyst. Now, I'm reigniting and enhancing the top-notch skills I excelled at, ready to make a significant impact on a great organization. This portfolio is step 1 (currently in process). _
